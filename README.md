# Battleship

An online implementation of the battleship gameboard. The user places 5 different ships at locations of their choice, then attacks the opponent's board, aiming to take down all the enemy ships. The first person to have all their ships sunk loses.

This project was made as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s full-stack JS curriculum.
